# 🗺️ AI Community Platform Roadmap

## Vision & Mission

Building a universal, modular ecosystem where autonomous AI agents and classical microservices act as flexible "building blocks" to construct systems of any complexity. Our goal is to democratize AI agent development and provide enterprise-ready infrastructure for the next generation of digital employees.

## ⚠️ Current Status: MVP Development Phase

> **Important:** The platform is actively developing core features. We follow strict OpenSpec proposal workflow with mandatory migrations, TDD, and quality gates. Check [Workflow Guidelines](docs/WORKFLOW_GUIDELINES.md) for development practices.
