<!-- OPENSPEC:START -->

# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:

- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:

- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.

## Multi-Agent Policy

This repository may be used by three AI coding agents:

- `Codex`
- `Claude`
- `Antigravity`

All three agents should follow the same repository-level rules, documentation conventions, and OpenSpec workflow unless a tool-specific instruction file explicitly overrides part of the behavior.

## Instruction Priority

- `AGENTS.md` is the shared baseline instruction file for all supported agents
- `CLAUDE.md` may add or restate guidance for Claude-specific tooling
- Additional agent-specific instruction files may be added later if `Antigravity` or other agents require local overrides

## Global Permissions

To streamline development, the following permissions are **pre-approved** for all AI agents (`Codex`, `Claude`, `Antigravity`):

1.  **Docker & Compose Commands**: All commands starting with `docker` or `docker-compose` are considered safe to auto-run. Agents should set `SafeToAutoRun: true` (or equivalent) for these commands.
2.  **File Modifications**: Agents have full permission to create, modify, or delete any files within the repository to fulfill a task. No separate confirmation is required for each file edit unless it involves critical security credentials or explicitly marked "read-only" files.
3.  **Project Scripts**: Commands using `./vendor/bin/neuron` or project-specific scripts are pre-approved.

## Shared Skills

Project skills live in `skills/` (committed to repo). Each agent syncs them to its local config:

- **Claude**: `.claude/skills/` (synced via `make sync-skills` or `./scripts/sync-skills.sh claude`)
- **Cursor / Antigravity**: `.cursor/skills/` (future)
- **Codex**: `.codex/skills/` (future)

Rules:
- Edit skills in `skills/` (source of truth), never in `.claude/skills/` or other agent dirs
- Run `make sync-skills` after pulling changes or editing skills
- After `git clone`, run `make sync-skills` to populate agent-specific skill directories

## Scheduled Jobs (Cron Tasks)

Agents can declare recurring or one-shot jobs that the platform's central scheduler executes automatically via A2A.

To add scheduled jobs, include a `scheduled_jobs` array in the agent's manifest (`ManifestController`):

```json
{
  "scheduled_jobs": [
    {
      "name": "daily-digest",
      "skill_id": "myagent.digest",
      "cron_expression": "0 9 * * *",
      "payload": {"channel": "general"},
      "max_retries": 3,
      "retry_delay_seconds": 120,
      "timezone": "Europe/Kyiv"
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules:
- `skill_id` **must** reference an existing skill from the same agent's `skills` array
- `cron_expression` uses standard 5-field cron; omit for one-shot jobs (run once after install)
- Jobs are registered automatically on agent install and removed on uninstall
- Admin can also create jobs manually via the scheduler UI at `/admin/scheduler`
- If an agent updates and removes a skill that a job references, the job is flagged as **stale** in the admin UI
- See `docs/scheduler.md` for full documentation and `apps/core/config/agent-card.schema.json` for the schema

## Working Expectation

When multiple agents are used on the same project:

- treat `docs/` as the shared product-facing source layer
- treat OpenSpec files as the source of truth for spec-driven changes
- avoid changing established conventions without updating the shared instructions first
